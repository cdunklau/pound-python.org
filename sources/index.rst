Guidelines
==========

To ensure that everyone has a pleasant experience, we ask that participants
take these guidelines to heart:

-   Follow the Python Software Foundation's `Code of Conduct`_. We want people
    to be kind, respectful and considerate. ``#python`` is a place for everyone
    to learn about Python.
-   Avoid strong or sexual language. People from all ages, nationalities and
    cultures use ``#python``, so please keep the language and demeanor
    acceptable to all.
-   Try to keep the discussion on-topic. ``#python`` is not a social chat
    channel; it is a technical help channel. Off-topic discussions can be moved
    to ``#python-offtopic`` or another channel.
-   Assume best intentions. People are in ``#python`` because they want to
    learn about Python, or because they want to help others with Python.
