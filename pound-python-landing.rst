Guidelines
==========

- Follow the Python Software Foundation's `Code of Conduct`_. We want people to be kind, respectful and considerate. #python is a place for everyone to learn about Python.
- Avoid strong or sexual language. People from all ages, nationalities and cultures use #python, so please keep the language and demeanor acceptable to all.
- Try to keep the discussion on-topic. #python is not a social chat channel; it is a technical help channel. Off-topic discussions can be moved to #python-offtopic or another channel.
- Assume best intentions. People are in #python because they want to learn about Python, or because they want to help others with Python.
